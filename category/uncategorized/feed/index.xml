<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-N6oeSU">The Birth of My Tech Journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>I first learned about computer programming in 7th grade, through Khan Academyâ€™s Intro to JS and HTML / CSS modules.<br>I marveled at how I was able to talk to computers as though they were people, writing commands that would produce my intended final product.<br>But once I reached the section on Object-Oriented Programming, I got stuck, and ended up taking a break from learning web development for 6 years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-WBYN3E">How I Discovered Techie Youth</h2>



<p>I was randomly selected to participate in Techie Youthâ€™s Learn to E-Earn through a random placement by New Yorkâ€™s Summer Youth Employment Program.<br>Techie Youth, a non-profit charity, provides career training and education resources to empower teens in foster-care and other at-risk youth.<br>The Learn to E-Earn program in particular is an opportunity for all youth to learn key skills in technology to advance their career journey.<br>Joining Techie Youthâ€™s E-Earn program provided me the opportunity to finally revisit my earlier passion for computing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-WBYN3E">Skills I&#8217;ve Learned Through Techie Youth</h2>



<p>Through the different course units, I became exposed to various new remote tech careers, ranging from web development, data analysis, recruitment, to writing blogs like this one!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-4qUSpc">Introductory Units</h3>



<p>All students start the program by participating in two prerequisite units to build a foundation for a successful career.</p>



<p>I got to update my online profile, edit my resume, and develop a cover letter template. I also learned strategies to ace job interviews and network strategically with other people such as potential mentors.</p>



<p>To supplement this, I learned how to improve my own life quality and overall work productivity by managing my time, stress, and health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-4qUSpc">Web Development</h3>



<p>Once students finish the prerequisite units, theyâ€™re able to move on to any elective units of their choice!&nbsp;</p>



<p>I decided to pick up right where I had left off 6 years ago by using the web development unit to brush up on my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>



<p>In just a few days, I was able to review skills that initially took me a year to build, thanks to the clear and direct resources linked in Techie Youthâ€™s units.</p>



<p>I then moved on to preview various other computing languages such as PHP and Python, frameworks like WordPress and Node.JS, and software like GitHub.</p>



<p>All of these sections helped me gain a well-rounded understanding of how different components of web development work together to produce a smooth user experience.</p>



<p>To conclude this unit, I used the skills I gained to create a personal website (which youâ€™re on right now)! I used the Intrace theme on WordPress, customized it using HTML and CSS to make the website responsive on mobile devices, and then hosted my website for free on GitHub Pages.</p>



<p>While Iâ€™ve come across lots of bumps along the way, being able to produce a portfolio website has been a thrilling experience!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-4qUSpc">Writing Skills</h3>



<p>Ever since my creative writing class in 10th grade, I knew that I loved writing about myself. So now that I created a functional personal website, why not supplement it by learning how to write blogs?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through Techie Youthâ€™s writing unit, I became exposed to various types of remote writing jobs, many of which I had never heard of previously.</p>



<p>Who knew that you could make an entire profession out of ghostwriting, transcribing, or producing technical writing? Not me!</p>



<p>I learned how to adapt my writing style to accommodate different professions. For example, the way a customer service agent communicates might not be the same as a prose author, which definitely wonâ€™t be the same as a journal or grant writer.</p>



<p>I also learned strategies to make blog posts easier to digest, such as incorporating headings to make content easily skimmable.</p>
