<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-N6oeSU">What is Self-Sufficiency?</h2>



<p>Self-sufficiency can have several meanings. In general, being financially self-sufficient means achieving financial independence &#8211; being able to provide for and support yourself without relying on external assistance, such as family or credit cards.</p>



<p>For many people, this means being able to work your own jobs as needed to pay for your own bills. For others, this can go as far as to mean only consuming that which you produced yourself &#8211; such as even producing your own food!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-P7YAyu">Why is Self-Sufficiency Important?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a no-brainer that being in a state of financial instability can be a large stress factor for families. In fact, according to the American Psychological Association, 72% of Americans experience financial stress at least occasionally, with 22% being extremely stressed.</p>



<p>Once you become self-sufficient, you are no longer dependent on outside factors that are beyond your control. Sometimes, things will still happen &#8211; emergencies, companies going bankrupt, budget reductions. You won&#8217;t be severely affected by this though, since you know you can find a way to maintain your lifestyle.</p>



<p>Additionally, you&#8217;ll gain the freedom to own your own time to do what you want to do, without being restricted by finances.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll also be able to make a larger impact on those in need, by making larger contributions to impactful charities. </p>



<p>Self-sufficiency helps make an even larger impact at the societal level. As more people become financially self-sufficient, society at large receives higher quality healthcare and education, and crime rates decrease as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-WBYN3E">Barriers that Prevent Self-Sufficiency?</h2>



<p>Despite how beneficial self-efficiency is for society, systemic issues in all sectors of life make it more difficult for low-income families to achieve financial stability.</p>



<p>For example, the households who use high-cost lending options &#8211; such as payday loans and check-cashing outlets &#8211; are those who can least afford it, as reported by Policy Link. These risky alternatives in turn put low-income families at a higher risk of foreclosure and losing equity, ultimately preventing financial mobility.</p>



<p>Low-income communities are also much less likely to access quality education, are unequally targeted by the criminal justice system, and are disproportionately impacted by chronic conditions while still being less likely to afford the required treatments.</p>



<p>According to the National Center for Children in Poverty (<a href="https://www.policylink.org/sites/default/files/BreakingTheCycle_0.pdf ">https://www.policylink.org/sites/default/files/BreakingTheCycle_0.pdf</a>), 38% of children live in low-income families nationally.</p>



<p>These and many other financial barriers continue to widen the income gap, making it more difficult for these families and youth to achieve financial stability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-vxiOHq">How Can We Improve Self-Sufficiency?</h2>



<p>One of the most meaningful ways we can increase the self-sufficiency of youth is by improving the financial literacy education provided in schools.</p>



<p>We need to provide our youth with the foundational knowledge they need to make strategic and informed financial decisions.</p>



<p>This is especially important for youth as they make a major financial decision: how to fund their college education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Champlain&#8217;s National High School Financial Literacy Report describes (<a href="https://www.champlain.edu/centers-of-experience/center-for-financial-literacy/report-national-high-school-financial-literacy/the-case-for-high-school-financial-literacy/">https://www.champlain.edu/centers-of-experience/center-for-financial-literacy/report-national-high-school-financial-literacy/the-case-for-high-school-financial-literacy/</a>), many students need to take loans to fund their college education, but don&#8217;t completely understand factors that weigh into these decisions (such as financial aid, loans, debt, inflation, and credit scores).</p>



<p>Additionally, a significant amount of youth are working to some capacity. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/youth.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/youth.pdf</a>), 60.5% of all youth between ages 16-21 were working in July 2021. During the school year, the National Center for Education Statistics (<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_ssa.pdf">https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_ssa.pdf</a>) reports that 43% of all full-time and 81% of all part-time undergraduate students were employed in 2018.</p>



<p>This makes it imperative that youth receive the proper financial literacy education to gain knowledge on concepts such as budgeting, loans, getting out of debt, savings, having multiple income streams, building your credit score, investment options, finding the right banks, etc.</p>



<p>A study by the FEDS&#8217;s Division of Research &amp; Statistics and Monetary Affairs (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2014/201468/201468pap.pdf">https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2014/201468/201468pap.pdf</a>) found that students who are mandated to receive financial literacy education ultimately have higher credit scores and lower delinquency rates than those in states where such education isn&#8217;t required. For example, students in Texas who received financial education 3 years after such education became mandated by law saw a 13-point credit score increase compared to those in control states.</p>



<p>Therefore, it’s clear current research supports that access to financial literacy education can make a major impact on a youth’s future financial growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-afHOGH">Techie Youth&#8217;s Approach</h2>



<p>Techie Youth is a non-profit organization that strives to increase financial literacy and overall career readiness for all youth.</p>



<p>The Learn to E-Learn program is a completely free online series of modules that teach youth how to earn income online through entrepreneurship and other remote careers.</p>



<p>These courses range from careers such as web development to talent acquisition to even writing. They ultimately help prepare youth to enter an entry level career after graduation from the program, and to ultimately get closer to becoming self-sufficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would like to see this program be extended to include financial literacy as another required unit. I would also like to see different levels of certificates offered, including a smaller certificate for completing the prerequisite units to still acknowledge the skills learned by students who may not have the time to commit to the full program.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-N6oeSU">The Birth of My Tech Journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>I first learned about computer programming in 7th grade, through Khan Academy’s Intro to JS and HTML / CSS modules.<br>I marveled at how I was able to talk to computers as though they were people, writing commands that would produce my intended final product.<br>But once I reached the section on Object-Oriented Programming, I got stuck, and ended up taking a break from learning web development for 6 years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-WBYN3E">How I Discovered Techie Youth</h2>



<p>I was randomly selected to participate in Techie Youth’s Learn to E-Earn through a random placement by New York’s Summer Youth Employment Program.<br>Techie Youth, a non-profit charity, provides career training and education resources to empower teens in foster-care and other at-risk youth.<br>The Learn to E-Earn program in particular is an opportunity for all youth to learn key skills in technology to advance their career journey.<br>Joining Techie Youth’s E-Earn program provided me the opportunity to finally revisit my earlier passion for computing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-WBYN3E">Skills I&#8217;ve Learned Through Techie Youth</h2>



<p>Through the different course units, I became exposed to various new remote tech careers, ranging from web development, data analysis, recruitment, to writing blogs like this one!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-4qUSpc">Introductory Units</h3>



<p>All students start the program by participating in two prerequisite units to build a foundation for a successful career.</p>



<p>I got to update my online profile, edit my resume, and develop a cover letter template. I also learned strategies to ace job interviews and network strategically with other people such as potential mentors.</p>



<p>To supplement this, I learned how to improve my own life quality and overall work productivity by managing my time, stress, and health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-4qUSpc">Web Development</h3>



<p>Once students finish the prerequisite units, they’re able to move on to any elective units of their choice!&nbsp;</p>



<p>I decided to pick up right where I had left off 6 years ago by using the web development unit to brush up on my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>



<p>In just a few days, I was able to review skills that initially took me a year to build, thanks to the clear and direct resources linked in Techie Youth’s units.</p>



<p>I then moved on to preview various other computing languages such as PHP and Python, frameworks like WordPress and Node.JS, and software like GitHub.</p>



<p>All of these sections helped me gain a well-rounded understanding of how different components of web development work together to produce a smooth user experience.</p>



<p>To conclude this unit, I used the skills I gained to create a personal website (which you’re on right now)! I used the Intrace theme on WordPress, customized it using HTML and CSS to make the website responsive on mobile devices, and then hosted my website for free on GitHub Pages.</p>



<p>While I’ve come across lots of bumps along the way, being able to produce a portfolio website has been a thrilling experience!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-4qUSpc">Writing Skills</h3>



<p>Ever since my creative writing class in 10th grade, I knew that I loved writing about myself. So now that I created a functional personal website, why not supplement it by learning how to write blogs?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through Techie Youth’s writing unit, I became exposed to various types of remote writing jobs, many of which I had never heard of previously.</p>



<p>Who knew that you could make an entire profession out of ghostwriting, transcribing, or producing technical writing? Not me!</p>



<p>I learned how to adapt my writing style to accommodate different professions. For example, the way a customer service agent communicates might not be the same as a prose author, which definitely won’t be the same as a journal or grant writer.</p>



<p>I also learned strategies to make blog posts easier to digest, such as incorporating headings to make content easily skimmable.</p>
